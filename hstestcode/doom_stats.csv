22,Natural,Bushfire,Great Divide Complex,"Victoria experienced a very adverse fire season during 2006 - 2007. Lightning ignited a number of fires on 1 December 2006 and some later merged to form what is known as the 'Great Divide Complex' fires in eastern Victoria. The area burnt mostly public land and was estimated to be in the vicinity of 1.2 and 1.3 million hectares by the end of the season. On 7 February 2007, The Great Divide fires were finally contained after 69 days. There were also a number of other fires (Tawonga Gap burned 33,500 hectares and Tatong burned 33,000). Despite the severity of the fire season, housing and private asset losses were remarkably low. In total, 51 dwellings of which 21 were classified as primary residences were destroyed and hundreds of stock and farm fencing were lost in the fires. One man died in a vehicle accident while assisting a property owner to prepare for fire impact.  Thousands of community volunteers and career emergency service personnel across state, regional and community levels worked in partnership to ensure the fires were eventually brought under control. A further component to the response was the support and assistance from New Zealand, United States, Canadian and interstate colleagues.  By 7 February, more than 1400 firefighters had been injured in the fire fighting effort (including bruises, cuts, blisters, burns, dehydration, broken limbs and spider bites). More than 400 St John Ambulance volunteers, including doctors, nurses and first aid officers provided medical assistance. On 16 December, 11 New Zealand firefighters were injured while fighting the fire in the Howqua Valley in north-east Victoria.  On 16 January 2007 power lines were cut which severely disrupted Melbourne electricity supplies. On the same day, a fire threatened to close Tullamarine Airport. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) worked with Melbourne Water to keep the fires out of the water catchments.  A significant number of people were evacuated during the fires. Relief centres were established to accommodate evacuees. Some mountain tourist complexes were evacuated due to fires including Mount Buller and Thredbo Village in New South Wales, the latter due to a fire that started from a lightning strike at Hermit Mountain and crossed the border.  Victoria experienced widespread effects from the fires. Numerous schools in the high country and some parts of Gippsland were forced to close due to the fire threat and outside play at school was banned in some instances due to smoke haze. The smoke haze reportedly caused some respiratory symptoms and aggravated conditions such as asthma. Haze also ffected traffic and delayed flights in and out of Melbourne airport. On 20 December, the Environment Protection Authority recorded its worst bushfire smoke since records began, with visibility reduced to two km in Melbourne's central business district.  During the fire season, the Country Fire Authority, Department of Sustainability and Environment and Parks Victoria received operational assistance from other states and a significant international contingent:    ACT - 37 personnel  NSW - 1050 personnel  NT - 108 personnel  SA - 10 personnel  Qld - 14 personnel  WA - 20 personnel  Canada - 52 personnel  New Zealand - 115 personnel  USA - 114 personnel    The Victorian and Federal Government provided financial assistance to aid personal, physical and economic recovery from the fire disaster.  The Insurance Council of Australia did not report any cost for this particular fire.",2006,-36.71800995,147.14521790,,,1400,1,,,51,VIC,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=22,"$704,000,000.00",$0.00
503,Natural,Cyclone,Cyclone Yasi,"Cyclone Yasi developed as a tropical low north-west of Fiji on 29 January 2011. On 30 January, it was named Yasi by the Fiji Meteorological Service. On 2 February, it was upgraded to a Category 5 system and made landfall near Mission Beach (138 km south of Cairns) between midnight and 1 am (AEST) early on Thursday 3 February. It weakened to a tropical low near Mount Isa around 10 pm on 3 February.  In response to warnings about the expected severity of the cyclone, and possible storm surges, approximately 10,000 northern Queenslanders living in low-lying areas evacuated to more than 100 official evacuation centres. Significant numbers were accommodated in unofficial evacuation centres established by communities and church groups. Thousands of people left the area and sought refuge with family and friends.  Flights out of the region were fully booked. The entire hospital population, more than 300 patients, were evacuated to other regional hospitals and Brisbane by the the Australian Defence Force, Royal Flying Doctor Service and other methods.  This was an unprecedented evacuation effort.  The eye of the cyclone passed over Dunk Island and Mission Beach between Innisfail and Townsville bringing significant winds, the highest estimated at 285 km per hour. Considerable damage occurred to the towns of Tully, Cardwell, Tully Heads, Innisfail, Ingham, Mission Beach, El Arish, Silkwood and Silky Oak and localities, however, the cyclone&rsquo;s worst impact missed the major centres of Townsville and Cairns. Overall, approximately 1000 people reported significant damage to their homes. Other impacts include power loss to more than 200,000 properties, cars were found metres away from where they were left and boats were piled on top of each other in some regions.  Rainfall totals for the 24 hour period to 9 am Thursday 3 February were 200-300 mm in the area between Cairns and Ayr, causing some flooding. A 5 m tidal surge was observed at the storm tide gauge at Cardwell. Other sea inundation occurred between the beaches north of Cairns and Alva Beach, and there was some inundation in parts of the city of Townsville.  The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated the cyclone caused a $300 million hit to agriculture, particularly affecting banana and sugarcane crops.  The Federal Government processed over $250 million worth of recovery grants in the first three weeks after the storm through Centrelink. Financial help was also available in the form of concessional loans for cyclone hit farmers up to $650,000.  There was one recorded death.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the preliminary 2011 damage at $1412 million.",2011,-17.85067558,146.10992430,,,,1,"$1,412,000,000.00",1000,,QLD,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=503,"$1,416,000,000.00",$0.00
612,Natural,Flood,New South Wales - 2012,"The combination of a high pressure system over the southern Tasman Sea and a trough over Queensland directed moist east to north-easterly winds across New South Wales. This generated patchy rain areas and isolated thunderstorms and heavy rain over the north of the state.  Minor to major flood warnings were issued for communities on the Mid North, Coffs Harbour and North Coast of New South Wales. There were reports of 300 mm falling in the space of three days in areas of the Bellinger River Valley and the Orara River catchment.  More than 2000 people were isolated by the rising floodwaters, with a number of road closures such as at the Pacific Highway and a caravan park in a low lying area evacuated.  From the 24 - 25 January New South Wales received almost 340 mm of rain. Overnight on the 24 January, the Tweed Valley saw heavy falls with 86 mm of rain at Couchy Creek, 100 mm at Numinbah and 100 mm at Bald Mountain.  Residents were isolated in the towns of Darkwood, near Coffs Harbour, the Thora and Kalang Valleys, and in Bellingen, on the Mid North Coast, where the flooded Bellinger River cut the town in two. More than a dozen homes and businesses in Bellingen were inundated. The Bellinger River at the Bellingen Bridge peaked at around 7 m, short of the 8.2 m that constitutes major flooding.  A landslide and waterfalls blocked the Waterfall Way between Dorrigo and Bellingen. Bellingen received 180 mm of rain in the 24 hours to 9 am on 27 January.  During this time the State Emergency Services received more than 1000 calls for assistance and over 50 flood rescues occurred.  By the beginning of February more than 16,500 people across the state were isolated, with the worst areas being Gunnedah and Wee Waa. Twenty-seven aircraft worked to supply those areas isolated.  On 5 February the Namoi River peaked at over 8 m in Gunnedah and the Mehi River near Moree reached more than 10.6 m, similar to the height reached in 1976 floods. Approximately 300 homes in Moree were inundated, and 1600 people were evacuated.  The concern became from floodwaters from Queensland moving downstream to northern areas of New South Wales such as Mungindi, Walgett, Bourke, Collarenebri and Brewarrina.  On 9 February, heavy rains caused flash flooding across western Sydney and the Illawarra, with the SES receiving approximately 450 calls for assistance.  On 20 February a similar event occurred with flash flooding across Sydney and the Illawarra prompting more than 300 requests for assistance to the SES. Terry Hills recorded 61 mm in an hour and Peakhurst recorded 26 mm in just ten minutes. Other suburbs affected included Banksia, Rockdale, Padstow Heights, Sylvania, Five Dock and Rosebery.  Up to 8000 people remained isolated for weeks in the north-west, receiving approximately 50 ton of daily deliveries such as medication, mail and food.  Heavy rains from the end of February to the beginning of March saw more than 75 per cent of New South Wales under water or threatened by floodwaters. Twenty-four hour rainfall totals to 9 am on 1 March reached up to 123 mm in Coolamon, 84 mm in Cootamundra, 83 mm in Broken Hill and widespread falls between 30 - 80 mm in the Illawarra district. Over 1700 people from the four towns of Bega, Eastgrove in Goulburn, Cooma and south-west Cowra were evacuated on 1-2 March.  Sydney's Warragamba Dam spilt at approx 6.53 pm on 2 March for the first time since 1998, causing authorities to cut power to 160 homes. The spillage prompted the evacuation of 1900 people from the Hawkesbury Nepean Valley area.The town of Pooncarie in western New South Wales received approximately 174 mm of rain and Ivanhoe 154 mm for the 48 hours to 9 am on Thursday, breaking two-day rainfall records.  In Towamba approximately 367 people were isolated following the closure of the Princes Highway. The SES responded to more than 740 requests for help as the large, slow-moving trough set in.  Approximately 4600 people across the state were subject to evacuation orders and 2500 people were isolated, mostly on rural properties.  Approximately 9000 people were evacuated from Wagga Wagga and a state of emergency was declared as the town's flood levee was tested by a peak of 10.6 m on 6 March, risking inundation of more than 3000 properties.  Evacuations continued throughout the first week of March with approximately 236 people door knocked in the Lachlan River area, 600 people ordered to evacuate in Griffith, and flood evacuation orders issued for Forbes, Flowerdale, Urana, Barellan, Yenda, North Wagga, Gillenbah and parts of Gumly Gumly. The town of Forbes was cut in three by floodwaters, inundating dozens of businesses and homes in the CBD.More than 400,000 sandbags were distributed across New South Wales to protect communities from floodwaters.

Approximately 30 towns across the state's north-east were inundated, leaving 1000 properties isolated. Almost 2000 homes were flooded and more than 17,000 people requested emergency assistance.  On 12 March the Insurance Council of Australia stated that insurers had already received claims totalling more than $64 million from flood-affected homeowners in Victoria and New South Wales. Insurers received 8,200 claims across the declared catastrophe zone. On 31 January one person drowned when they attempted to drive through floodwaters 1.6 m deep.  On 4 March one person died and two others were admitted to hospital with hypothermia and severe bruising after their four wheel drive was caught in a swollen causeway near Braidwood in the Southern Tablelands.  On 9 March one person was found dead in floodwaters north of Bourke, and their vehicle partially submerged in a causeway.  To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $17,256,000 allocated to 14,834 claimants  affected in the northern part of the state and $29,991,000 was allocated to pay over 28,860 claimants affected by flood in the southern New South Wales region.

269,Natural,Flood,"Grafton, Kempsey and North Coast New South Wales","The development of a low-pressure system off the New South Wales North Coast caused torrential rain on 2 March, and dissipated into Queensland. Heavy rainfalls intensified over the following days, particularly in the Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie regions.  River systems in the region were at capacity and tidal systems in correlation with the king tides caused further complexities with rising flood water. The following river systems were affected; Richmond, Clarence, Bellinger, Nambucca, Macleay, Hastings, Manning, Paterson and Hunter. The rising water exceeded levees in Kempsey and the traffic bridge at Kempsey peaked at a height of 6.9 m. Other significant damage included; 94 businesses with an estimated direct cost of $28,000 per business, streets closed to traffic and 100 people evacuated from the Mirriwina Gardens settlement (50 km north-west of Kempsey).  The Clarence River also threatened to exceed levees causing precautionary evacuations of more than 1000 people, including 80 patients from the Grafton Hospital. The Grafton levee bank was able to hold the water within the river system, which finally peaked at 7.75 m.  The effects of the flooding were wide spread and inundations and dislocation of services affected up to 28 local government areas.The Pacific Highway, the main route in many of these regions, was cut for several days. Rail services were also reported as suspended. Furthermore, reports of damage included; Yamba becoming isolated, Gladstone and Smithtown where sewerage infrastructure failed and Ulmarra (population of 470) was ordered to evacuate. Bellingen, Thora, Kaland and Darkwood, South West Rocks, Hat Head, and Crescent Head were isolated and required food and medical drops by helicopter.  The response units included; State Emergency Services (SES) a contingent of 1300 volunteers from 83 units, Rural Fire Service (RFS), New South Wales Fire Brigade (NSWFB), Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA), Police, and Council workers. Additional supporting equipment used in the response included; ten heavy tankers, 12 flood boats, and 11 helicopters.  Estimated costs to roads and bridges was $3 million, water and sewerage infrastructure $500,000.  The enormity of the recovery resulted in the Premier establishing a Government Task Force to coordinate the operation. Brigadier Philip McNamara was appointed the regional coordinator for the recovery, and was based in Coffs Harbour.

In total four people died and six people were injured as a result of these fires.  Considerable losses and damage occurred to property and infrastructure:    Houses destroyed: 57 (19 of these principle residences)  Buildings: 359 farm buildings lost, including 39 woolsheds and 22 hay sheds  Stock losses: 64,265 (63,243 sheep, 557 cattle and 464 other stock) and over 2,500 commercial beehives  Area burnt: 160,000 hectares (60 percent public land, 40 per cent private land - Approximately 98,000 hectares of national parks and conservation areas and 6,000 hectares of State forest were burnt)  Fencing: 364 km of crown land boundary fencing and 2281 km of other boundary or internal fencing       The firefighting effort included more than 5000 volunteers, paid personnel and a significant assistance from interstate. Also on the ground were government, volunteer, business and community organisations who were involved in fire suppression activities and facilitating recovery efforts.  The following municipalities were impacted by the significant fire events:    Ararat Rural City  Baw Baw Shire  Glenelg Shire  Golden Plains Shire  Greater Geelong City  Horsham Rural City  Latrobe City  Moorabool Shire  Moyne Shire  Murrindindi Shire  Northern Grampians Shire  South Gippsland Shire  Southern Grampians Shire       Many local governments established emergency relief centres to provide initial support and shelter to evacuees during the fires and the establishment of recovery centres in Anakie, Ararat and Stawell after the fires had passed. Community meetings were undertaken, both pre-fire and during the fire events, which assisted in keeping the community informed.  The immediate effects of the fires were displacement of residents and tourists, closure of schools and loss of power supply to many properties. Longer term impacts include reduction in tourism trade; at least 112 staff were laid off as a result of the fires. The Wimmera Development Corporation estimated that tourism downturn resulting from the bushfire devastation will cost the Grampians regional economy up to $100 million.  The damage to environment and water catchments was significant. The Grampians and Gippsland fires had the greatest impact on water quality. Water authorities commenced both short-term and long-term risk management activities.  The Grampians fires also affected over 240 km of roads across the local and state road network. The most significant damage to the road network occurred on the forest road system, including 1200 km of forestry roads affected in the Grampian's National Park.

The most serious fires started in the Blue Mountains on 16 and 17 October.  The fires began on 13 October when strong winds and high temperatures caused a fire near Port Stephens and destroyed six houses. Several sheds and cars were also burnt in the fires and dozens of residents spent the night in evacuation centres. One person died at Lake Munmorah while protecting their home. Fires also occurred around the Hunter and Hawksbury regions. At the same time, more than 100 firefighters were fighting bushfires at Tangory Mountain, Webbs Creek, Wollemi National Park, the Southern Highlands and the Central Coast.  On 16 October, a defence training exercise at Marrangaroo near the Blue Mountains, accidently sparked a fire that became known as the &lsquo;State Mine Fire&rsquo;. It had a perimeter of 190km and eventually burnt nearly 46,000 hectares between Lithgow and Mt Tomah. At its most severe, the fire travelled 25 km per hour through bushland.  Thousands of people in Lithgow were evacuated and the communities of Bell, Bilpin, Berambing, Clarence, Dargan, Hartley Vale, Mount Wilson were also affected. The fire devastated the recently restored tourist attraction, Zig Zag Railway, with equipment and train carriages destroyed.  On 17 October two more major fires began in the lower Blue Mountains: one near Mt Victoria and the other at Springwood. Wimallee and Yellowrock were the worst affected communities with 193 homes destroyed and 100 damaged. Staff and patients at the Springwood Hospital were evacuated as a precaution. With the three fires burning uncontrollably in the Blue Mountains, on 18 October, Victoria sent fire crews and equipment to assist with the NSW firefighting efforts. A State of Emergency was announced for NSW on 20 October.  By 22 October the State Mine Fire had travelled south and was threatening to join up with the Mt Victoria Fire. The Rural Fire Service decided to deliberately allow the State Mine Fire to join the Mount Victoria Fire in a controlled way by managing fuel loads and back-burning to create firebreaks. While this was a high risk strategy, by 25 October cooler weather conditions allowed firefighters to bring the three Blue Mountains Fires under control. The fires were declared extinguished on 13 November. A total of approximately 118,000 hectares was burnt across the state.

In the early afternoon the temperature was approximately 40 &ordm; C and there were almost 750 bathers in the water. Three 'dumpers' or large waves fell upon the beach, pushing water 30 m up the sand and causing a huge rip as it receded. Many of the swimmers were caught in the rip, unable to return to shore.  There were 60 lifesavers on the beach at the time, and in approximately 20 minutes they rescued 245 people; Australia's largest rescue operation. Medical centres were set up on the sand, and approximately 60 people were rescued from immersion and 35 revived from an unconscious state. However five people died, and the Coroner found the cause to be accidental drowning.",1938,-33.89019012,151.27423100,,,95,5,,,,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=603,"$67,500,000.00",$0.00
3487,Natural,Cyclone,Cyclone Oswald,"Tropical Cyclone Oswald formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria on 21 January 2013. It made landfall at night between Kowanyama,and Pormpuraaw on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, as a weak category one system with winds up to 100 km per hour. The following morning, as the cyclone moved inland it was downgraded to a tropical low system. The low moved toward the east coast, near Cooktown on 23 January and then tracked slowly to the south-south-east just inland from the coast, impacting areas near Townsville on 24 January. The weather system stalled over the St. Lawrence-Rockhampton area on the 25th and 26th, and then tracked south to near Dalby west of Brisbane on the 28th, finally accelerating in a southerly direction eventually moving offshore south of Sydney on 29 January.  The ex-tropical cyclone brought with it a heavy monsoonal rainfall system that lasted for approximately one week. Most of the eastern areas of Queensland, and the coast of New South Wales ending in the Wollongong area experienced very heavy rainfall during the period from 22 to 29 January 2013. On 25 January, areas around Rockhampton recorded rainfall for a 24 hour period in excess of 300 mm. Rainfall for the areas between Rockhampton and Bundaberg alone were heavy enough to break the January monthly rainfall records. On 28 January, the most extreme daily rainfall for the week occurred over the Gold Coast Hinterland and New South Wales border catchment and the edge of the Brisbane river catchment where rainfall for a 24 hour period was in excess of 700 mm both hitting record levels. The Queensland State Emergency Service received 1800 calls for help in 24 hours on the 28 January, mostly in the south-east areas of the state.  Six people were killed due to the extreme weather over the course of the week. Thousands were forced to evacuate, 2000 people were isolated by floodwaters for some days requiring emergency supply drops. Approximately 40 water rescues took place by State Emergency Service volunteers.  Key infrastructure was damaged and destroyed, estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The rail service was closed between Cairns and Townsville, the Weipa port shut down for several days, airlines cancelled many domestic flights between New South Wales and Queensland, travellers were stranded as they tried to return home after the long weekend, 200 schools were closed on the first day of school for the year and the worst ever power outages occurred in Queensland affecting 283,000 properties.  On 27 January, the system moved south impacting Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast with damaging to destructive winds, torrential rain, dangerous surf and tidal inundation for a 24 hour period. Winds reached 131 km per hour at Cape Byron. Mt Crosby water treatment plant was shut down owing to turbidity in the Brisbane River. Water was released from the Wivenhoe dam from 91per cent to 88 per cent to cope with flood waters. Water was also released from North Pine Dam and Somerset Dam.  Torrential rainfall and flooding also occurred in northern New South Wales particularly near Lismore and Grafton where approximately 2000 evacuations occurred. The New South Wales State Emergency Service attended to more than 2900 calls for assistance Eight New South Wales river systems had flood warnings in place. Coastal erosion of beaches was evidenced in these regions along with sea foam covering some roads and parks on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts.  Overall, Bundaberg was the worst affected city with 2000 homes and 200 businesses inundated with flood water. The Burnett river was running at approximately 70 km per hour and threatening houses. Despite a mandatory evacuation order issued to 5000 residents, an emergency airlift was the only option for some stranded residents. Eighteen helicopters were utilised in a rescue effort evacuating more than 1000 people trapped by flood waters in North Bundaberg and other most-at-risk areas to at least nine evacuation centres which was a record evacuation effort in Australia. The Bundaberg hospital was also evacuated and approximately 130 patients were transferred to hospitals in Brisbane.  On 31 January, in North Bundaberg, approximately 7000 residents were forced out of their homes and not allowed to return until they were checked and declared safe. Defence personnel, 180 in total, went house to house within an exclusion zone, conducting search and rescue operations. Defence personnel also helped to repair damaged infrastructure and clean people's homes as part of the initial recovery operation.  Financial assistance and grants were made available to eligible Queensland flood victims, including:    Queensland Floods Appeal 2013 payments  Emergent Assistance Grant  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)  Essential Services Safety and Reconnection Grant.    The Queensland government also provided financial help and support services to business owners and primary producers such as low interest loans and clean up and recovery grants. Other assistance included freight subsidies, Individual Disaster Stricken Property (IDSP) declarations and leasehold rent relief.  The Federal Attorney-General announced flood and storm victims, employees, small business persons and farmers could apply for the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments:    New South Wales - January 2013: $17,254,788 scheduled to be paid.  Queensland - January 2013:  $141,449,554 scheduled to be paid.    Natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements were provided as a joint commonwealth and state / territory government initiative for local government areas.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the January 2013 damage at $121 million for New South Wales and $977 million for Queensland.

202,Transport,Road,Lake Illawarra,"The Lake Illawarra was a steel single screw steam turbine motor vessel, bulk carrier. The Lake Illawarra sank after running into and demolishing part of the Tasman Bridge that crossed the Derwent River at Hobart, 5 January 1975. The vessel was en route from Port Pirie in South Australia with a cargo of zinc. When approaching the bridge, the captain reduced speed, but was finding it difficult to align the ship to the central navigation span of the bridge. Despite several attempts to change the course, the ship was difficult to manage in part due to the lack of speed. The master finally called out full speed astern in a last attempt to change the course of the ship when the ship veered into the pile capping of Pier 18 and then Pier 19 bringing the three unsupported spans of the bridge crashing into vessels' hull. The ship sank within minutes in deep water.  Seven crew members on the ship died and four cars ran over the gap into the Derwent River, five occupants died while others managed to escape from the two vehicles which teetered on the edge of the gap. The collapse effectively divided Hobart in two. Police and emergency services were called into action and within an hour a ferry was traversing the river. The next day there were three private ferries and one government run ferry in operation. Eastern shore residents were severely hindered by the collapse as most hospitals, schools, businesses and government offices were located on the west shore.  A temporary bridge (the Bailey bridge) with one lane in each direction was built and opened to traffic on 16 December 1975. The federal government provided funding to rebuild the Tasman bridge at a cost of $44 million and it re-opened 8 October 1977.",1975,-42.94033813,147.38296510,,,,12,,,,TAS,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=202,"$48,000,000.00",$0.00

On 16 February itself, there was low humidity, heat wave conditions and strong to gale force winds. Temperatures varied between high thirties and mid forties over most of eastern South Australia and Victoria with relative humidity generally less than 15 per cent.  The Victorian bushfire season had started in November 1982. There were 854 bushfires reported at this time including, Ballan, Mount Macedon on 1 February, Cann River and Mount Donna Buang.  On early Ash Wednesday morning there were 104 fires already burning in Victoria most controlled or contained, it was only after 2.00 pm that the situation exploded.  The Victorian fires formed several complexes.  1. Western district near Warrnambool. This fire started from a defective private power line. The resulting fire front was kilometres wide and moving at frightening speed. A cool change came through at 5.00 pm and the wind changed to the south-west. The fire headed toward the town of Terang. The fire passed the town to its north and was brought under control the next day. In total nine people died, 50,000 hectares burnt, 157 houses destroyed and 19,300 livestock was lost.  Another person died near Branxholme from a smaller fire caused by power line fault.  2. East Trentham - Macedon fire complex.

The main fire that started near Forcett caused significant damage to local townships, particularly Dunalley, east of Hobart, where more than half of the town&rsquo;s buildings and a primary school were destroyed. Other significant fire fronts were located at Lake Repulse and Bicheno.  The Forcett fire was first reported in bushland outside the town heading towards Dunalley, on Thursday 3 January 2013 at approximately 2.00 pm. The fire escaped containment lines the following afternoon fanned by strong winds and burned towards the coast at several points. More than 100 properties were destroyed and 2500 hectares of land were burnt by the afternoon of 6 January. At least 80 properties were either damaged or destroyed in Dunalley and nearby Boomer Bay, approximately 20 houses were destroyed at Murdunna and 40 per cent of structures were lost at Connelly&rsquo;s Marsh. The fire threatened the town of Taranna and on 14 January 2013 a Victorian volunteer firefighter was killed when undertaking back burning operations in the vicinity. An estimated 24,000 hectares were burnt in the fire and at its peak the perimeter of the fire approximated 200 km.  Thousands of locals and tourists were stranded as a result of the Forcett bushfire which effectively cut the Tasman Peninsula off from the rest of the state. The peninsula's main access road, the Arthur Highway, was closed from 4 to 13 January. People converged on Port Arthur to await evacuation by sea or road and due to shortages of food and other supplies, the community arranged for a fleet of boats to make deliveries to those stranded on the peninsula. Two private catamaran operators in Hobart were asked by police to help evacuate people from the Nubeena jetty.  Evacuees were then taken to Hobart where they were met by relatives and friends or taken in by volunteers.  The Highway was partially opened on 11 January to allow stranded people and supplies to get through and was eventually opened to general traffic on 13 January.  Community refuges were established at the Sorrell Memorial Hall, Nubeena Community Centre, Bicheno Community Hall and Swansea Football Ground. There was also a Recovery Centre established at City Hall, Hobart.  The electricity company, Aurora, reported approximately 300 electricity poles were destroyed on the Tasman Peninsula, consequently power outages are expected to be an issue for a considerable time.  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were made available to residents in the south-east and east of Tasmania, covering the affected local government areas of Sorell, Tasman and Glamorgan-Spring Bay. Other grants made available were immediate cash assistance grants, housing assistance grants, Aurora energy assistance and clean-up and assistance grants. A first stage recovery payment from the Red Cross Appeal Distribution Committee was distributed, providing $3000 per adult and $1000 per child by late January. The Department of Human Services has allocated over $7,845,000 to cover approximately 6900 claims.  The Insurance Council of Australia advised as at 1 February 2013 that 1783 insurance claims had been received with losses estimated at $86.7 million, about 85 per cent of these related to property, seven per cent for domestic vehicles, with the balance consisting of smaller claims for other losses.  The fire at Lake Repulse burnt more than 12,000 hectares and threatened the towns of Ellendale Ouse, Karanja, Westerway and Hamilton. Police allege it was started by an unattended campfire. The fire burnt for up to two weeks and was handed back to regional firefighters when conditions eventually improved. The other significant fire front was at Bicheno and Coles Bay where up to 15 properties were lost.  These fires were described as the worst in almost half a century. On 14 January a Tasmanian Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was established and the state moved to recovery mode.

By 8 January, there were over 100 fires burning, fueled by 40 degree Celsius temperatures.   The worst fire occured on 13 January when a fast moving bushfire in the Warrumbungle National Park near Coonabarabran destroyed more than 51 nearby homes and damaged many others. The lodge at the Siding Spring Observatory in the National Park was damaged along with other buildings. However, Australia's largest telescope the Anglo-Australian survived.  The other major areas affected by fire were Yass, Cooma and the Shoalhaven. One house was destroyed in Jugiong and a volunteer firefighter sustained burn injuries in Gundaroo and was airlifted to Sydney for hospital treatment.  A recovery centre was opened in Coonabarabran after the fire. A recovery coordinator was appointed on 21 January by Barry O&rsquo;Farrell concentrating on supporting the Warrumbungles fire affected community.  Approximately 131,000 hectares were burnt in total across the state and extensive farm infrastructure and fences damaged. Approximately 12,000 sheep were lost at an estimated cost of over $1,000,000. Wildlife losses were also significant. The Department teamed with farmers to establish a fodder and fencing donation register to assist farmers rebuilding after the fires.  On 15 January, the New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell, and the Federal Minister for Emergency Management, Nicola Roxon, announced Natural Assistance would be available to 51 Local Government Areas in New South Wales affected by bushfires. To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were $1,015,600 for over 830 claimants.

615,Natural,Flood,Victoria February 2012,"Heavy rain began in Victoria on 26 February 2012. A severe weather warning for flash flooding was issued for most of the state, including the South West, North Central, Northern Country, Wimmera, Mallee, Central, West and South Gippsland and North-East forecast districts.  The State Emergency Service (SES) responded to 650 calls for help across the state on the last days of February following heavy rain and thunderstorms. There was flash flooding and minor building damage across the state after rainfalls of between 50 and 100 mm. In towns such as Seymour there was 120 mm of rain causing flash flooding and road closures. Shops in the main street of Chiltern were flooded after 94 mm of rain fell. The Goulburn Valley Highway was closed north of Seymour due to rainfall. Broken Weir near Benalla recorded the highest rainfall with 167 mm. Castlemaine received 50 mm of rain in a 90 minute period. Police said 11 homes and six shops were flooded.  State Emergency Service (SES) crews were also kept busy dealing with flash flooding at Yarrawonga, Cobram and Shepparton. In addition they had over 350 calls for help in Melbourne, with the hardest hit areas including Brimbank, Doncaster, Emerald and Malvern. There were 89 calls for help in the Ballarat area when storms dumped almost 60 mm of rain. The Daylesford Hospital had some minor flooding, and streets and at least one building were flooded in the area.  On 1 March 2012, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a Severe Weather Warning for heavy rain for residents in the Northern Country, East Gippsland and North East forecast districts.  Broken Creek broke its banks and flooded the town of Numurkah, north of Shepparton. Numurkah Base Hospital and the adjoining Karinya Nursing Home both experienced flooding, with patients and residents evacuated. Flood waters peaked on 5 March and slowly receded with a State Emergency Service spokeswoman saying it would take at least a week for the water to recede completely. Approximately 40 homes and businesses were damaged. The hospital was later delared unsalvagable and limited services resumed from a temporary tent facility, followed by longstanding portables.  Locals and the SES in Nathalia constructed a temporary metal levee with thousands of sandbags, 750 m in length along the banks of Broken Creek, in an attempt to protect the town. Nathalia's temporary levee was purchased after floods hit the town in 1993; it has not been used until this event and it supplements a permanent levee around much of the Nathalia stretch of Broken Creek. Notwithstanding the levee the SES still issued an evacuation order for the town of Nathalia as some doubt existed as to the levees ability to contain the flood waters.  Flooding of Broken Creek, which flanks Nathalia, peaked on 9 March at 3.25 m. The town's evacuation notice was lifted 15 March 2012 and the metal levee dismantled on 20 March 2012.

Late on the 6th, the cyclone suddenly took a southerly direction and the eye crossed the coast 50 km west of Port Hedland at about 6am on 8 December 1975.  Despite Port Hedland not being in the centre of the storm it was subjected to strong winds exceeding 90 km per hour for approximately 10 hours with winds in excess of 120 km per hour for three hours. The maximum measured wind gust was 208 km per hour. Severe property damage occurred at Port Hedland and other townships nearby. Eighty-five per cent of all houses were damaged to some degree. Power and communications were lost for several days.  Heavy rainfall inland caused flooding. Marandoo, near Tom Price registered 591 mm while many other sites recorded rainfall over 400 mm. The heavy rain occurred along and just east of the cyclone track. Some of the two and three-day totals registered over the Hamersley Range represent in excess of a once in 100 year event.

Wind speeds were recorded at 267 km per hour at Learmonth and 174 km per hour at Onslow. By the 23 March at 4 am it was near the town of Mount Magnet and was moving southeast at 50 km per hour.  Cyclone Vance was downgraded to Category 1 and passed to the northeast of Kalgoorlie on the 23 March 2011 at approximately 3 pm.  The storm surge associated with Cyclone Vance caused severe erosion of the beachfront and marina at Exmouth and stranded three large barges on the edge of Beadon Creek at Onslow. The storm surge at Exmouth was measured at 3.5 m which resulted in a storm tide of 4.9 m.  Severe structural damage occurred to approximately 10 per cent of buildings in Exmouth; many more experienced less obvious damage due to the intrusion of rainwater. Other damage was recorded in the far west of Pilbara, including damage in the town of Cue. Water and power supplies throughout the Gascoyne and Goldfields were disrupted and many homesteads sustained wind or flooding damage. The main rail and road links to the eastern states were cut.

Already saturated catchments were inundated and major flooding quickly developed on the Warrego and Maranoa Rivers and many other inland systems. The towns of Jericho and Augathella were flooded and a section of the Longreach railway was washed away.  On the morning of 21 April, the Warrego River was rising rapidly. Later the same day the river peaked at over 8.5 m which was 1.5 m above the previous record. Levee banks protecting the town were ineffective and floodwaters spread through the town, necessitating the entire population of 3500 to be evacuated to the airport. Many residents climbed to their rooftops and had to be rescued by helicopter.  The low then moved south-east and torrential rains were experienced across large areas of New South Wales west of the Divide. There was major flooding on the Lachlan, Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers, among others. The Bogan river flooded into Nyngan. Despite the residents' ttempts to raise the levee banks by sand bagging, the levees could not withstand the flood and on the 23 April, as the river surged to 5.2 m, nearly one metre higher than the previous record, most of the town was inundated. The population of 2500 was evacuated to Dubbo, 160 km away.  The low then moved towards Victoria and produced torrential rains over Gippsland on 20 and 21 April with up to 350 mm recorded over the two day period. Major flooding occurred on the Thomson, Avon and Mitchell Rivers. Hectares of vegetable crops were destroyed by flood waters and highways cut. People were evacuated from low-lying areas.

Approximately 50 per cent of homes experienced some form of inundation. More than 700 homes or businesses in the region needed assistance, and more than 440 were damaged with approximately 288 properties affected in Mitchell and 290 affected in Roma. One hundred and twenty Australian Defence Force soldiers assisted with the clean up in these regions.  On 5 February mandatory evacuations were ordered for St George after it was predicted the Balonne River would peak at up to 15 m. With more than 2600 people from a population of 3000 evacuated, it was Queensland&rsquo;s largest evacuation in history. The Balonne River in St George passed its previous record of 13.48 m, peaking at 13.93 m, but the township remained protected by its 14.5 m levee with damage restricted to the 50 homes. St George also faced pollution problems as floodwaters damaged the local sewerage treatment plant, posing a major public health risk.  At the beginning of March, a category one cyclone off the south-east coast caused further flooding and six evacuation centres were opened across the coast to assist evacuated and displaced people.

The storm in June 2007 resulted in major flooding and widespread damage. Seven rivers burst their banks causing millions of dollars of damage to homes, businesses and farms, as well as a significant loss of public and private assets. The rapidly rising floodwaters forced dozens of rescues and evacuations. One person died as a result of the flood waters.

The rising waters made the roads in Wee Waa inaccessible to all but four-wheel drive vehicles. Water levels exceeded 6 m around 9:00 am on 27 November, before reaching 7 m on 29 November with major flooding.  Approximately 300 properties were isolated in Moree, and the town was cut in two after rising waters forced the closure of the local bridge.More properties were cut off in Gunnedah and the village of Garah, as waters in the Namoi, Gwydir, Peel and Mehi Rivers continued to rise. One person drowned after being pulled into a storm water drain in Bingara, near Inverell.  As the flood waters abated and moved downstream, the Department of Primary Industries were able to assess the flood damage. Hundreds of livestock, mainly sheep, died with most of the losses occurring between Garah and Weemelah. Fodder drops will continue to provide quality feed.  It has been estimated that approximately $52 million in flood damage has occurred to the cotton industry in the Gwydir Valley. The local growers' association says initial estimates are based on around 18,000 hectares; up to 30 per cent of the dryland crop and five per cent of irrigated crop being damaged. It warns these figures could worsen as the floodwaters move downstream inundating more cotton and upstream crops begin to emerge.

Australia&rsquo;s first six days of 2013 were among the hottest 20 days on record in terms of average maximums. The heatwave developed over a large region stretching from northern Victoria and inland New South Wales to central-west Queensland, across to north-western Western Australia and down to the Nullarbor coast.The national average maximum across Australia on 7 January was 40.33 &deg;C, beating the previous record set in 1972 by 0.16&deg;C.  In Perth, temperatures exceeded 37&deg;C for seven consecutive days. This heatwave caused 20 people to be hospitalised between the period 27 December and 3 January. St John Ambulance reported a doubling in call-outs for heatstroke, dehydration and burns from the previous week. On New Year&rsquo;s Eve, Western Australia recorded 42.1 &deg;C, 13 &deg;C above the December average. The state's average temperature for the last week of 2012 averaged a maximum of 39.3 &deg;C, making it the hottest week in 80 years. Records were broken in Alice Springs, with temperatures over 40 &deg;C for 17 days in a row and Oodnadatta, where temperatures exceeded 45 &deg;C for seven consecutive days.  On 17, January Sydney endured its hottest day ever, with a record temperature of 45.8 &deg;C. The Ambulance Service of New South Wales reported that more than 220 people had been treated for heat exposure or fainting. The heatwave stranded thousands of commuters, with dozens of trains delayed as steel wires buckled and a hose used to run a key signalling system melted. On the central coast, the heat caused an overhead wire to buckle onto a train at approximately 1.30 pm, trapping about 250 passengers for half an hour.

40,Transport,Rail,Brooklyn Train Collision,"On 6 May 1990, a Sydney-bound commuter train travelling from Newcastle crashed into the rear of a stalled chartered steam train. The 3801 locomotive, also bound for Sydney, had stopped on a rise from the Hawkesbury River and was building up steam to get up the grade (Cowan Bank) when the Sydney bound train emerged from the Boronia tunnel near Brooklyn and collided with the 3801.  The accident happened 5 km south of the Brooklyn Bridge, between the Hawkesbury River and the town of Cowan. A total of 93 people were injured and six people died. The front of the four-carriage Sydney train was derailed in the accident.  An interim ban was placed on the use of steam locomotives on the New South Wales railway system.  A Coronial inquiry found that a railway signal fault occurred due to sand being dumped on the rail by the driver of 3801 to provide traction when the train went into a violent wheel-spin as it approached the Boronia tunnel. A handbrake in one of the steam train's carriages may have been partially applied, the inquiry found, to cause the train to slow down. Just outside the tunnel, the driver opened the valve to full throttle and the steam train pulled to a complete stop and more sand was applied to the rails.  While the 3801 was attempting to climb the hill, the Sydney - Newcastle train was stopped at a red signal on the other side of the tunnel. The lights apparently fluctuated from red to green seemingly because of sand on the rails. When the lights stayed permanently on the green the urban train moved forward through the tunnel, when the crash with 3801 occurred. The force of the impact destroyed the last carriage of the historic train and demolished the front carriage of the Sydney train.  Those involved in the incident were cleared of blame, however, it was said that although the signals had tested satisfactorily, the sand applied to the line by 3801 may have caused them to malfunction on the day.",1990,-33.54511642,151.22560120,,,93,6,,,,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40,"$70,500,000.00",$0.00
